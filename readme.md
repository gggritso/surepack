# surepack

`surepack` is an interactive CLI packing list generator.

It asks a few basic questions (trip type, duration, temperature, etc.) and spits out a packing list.

```
~/C/surepack (master ∂ ↑)  surepack
? What kind of trip is it? (Use arrow keys)
❯ City Visit
  Cottage
  Road Trip
  Wedding
```
